With recent advances in computer vision and graphics, it is now pos- sible to generate videos with extremely realistic synthetic faces, even in real time. Countless applications are possible, some of which raise a legitimate alarm, call- ing for reliable detectors of fake videos. In fact, distinguishing between original and manipulated video can be a challenge for humans and computers alike, espe- cially when the videos are compressed or have low resolution, as it often happens on social networks. Research on the detection of face manipulations has been se- riously hampered by the lack of adequate datasets. To this end, we introduce a novel face manipulation dataset of about half a million edited images (from over 1000 videos). The manipulations have been generated with a state-of-the-art face editing approach. It exceeds all existing video manipulation datasets by at least an order of magnitude. Using our new dataset, we introduce benchmarks for clas- sical image forensic tasks, including classification and segmentation, considering videos compressed at various quality levels. In addition, we introduce a bench- mark evaluation for creating indistinguishable forgeries with known ground truth; for instance with generative refinement models.
